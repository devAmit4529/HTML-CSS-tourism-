    The <b>Red Fort</b> or <b>Lal Qila </b>(Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India
    that served as
    the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May
    1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to
    architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal
    architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

    The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of
    the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The
    fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.

    On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori
    Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the
    fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.

    The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.


    <br>The name Red Fort is a translation of the Hindustani <b>Lāl Qila </b>(Hindi: लाल क़िला, Urdu: لال قلعہ),deriving
    from its red sandstone walls. Lal was derived from Hindustani language meaning "Red" and Qalàh derived from Arabic
    word meaning "Fortress". As the residence of the imperial family, the fort was originally known as the "Blessed
    Fort" (Qila-i-Mubārak).Agra Fort is also known as Lāl Qila.

    <b>Architecture</b><br>
    The World Heritage Convention characterises the Red Fort as representing "the zenith of Mughal creativity". The fort
    synthesises Islamic palace structure with local traditions, resulting in a confluence of "Persian, Timurid, and
    Hindu architecture". The fort served as an inspiration for later buildings and gardens across the Indian
    subcontinent.
    <br>
    The Red fort has an area of 254.67 acres (103.06 ha) enclosed by 2.41 kilometres (1.50 mi) of defensive walls,
    punctuated by turrets and bastions that vary in height from 18 metres (59 ft) on the river side to 33 metres (108
    ft) on the city side. The fort is octagonal, with the north–south axis longer than the east–west axis. The marble,
    floral decorations and the fort's double domes exemplify later Mughal architecture.
    <br>
    It showcases a high level of ornamentation, and the Kohinoor diamond was reportedly part of the furnishings. The
    fort's artwork synthesises Persian, European and Indian art, resulting in a unique Shahjahani style rich in form,
    expression and colour. Red Fort is one of the building complexes of India encapsulating a long period of history and
    its arts. Even before its 1913 commemoration as a monument of national importance, efforts were made to preserve it
    for posterity.

    The Lahori and Delhi Gates were used by the public, and the Khizrabad Gate was for the emperor. The Lahori
    Gate is the main entrance, leading to a domed shopping area known as the Chatta Chowk (covered bazaar).

    <b>Major structures</b><br>
    The most important surviving structures are the walls and ramparts, the main gates, the audience halls and the
    imperial apartments on the eastern riverbank.

    <br><b>Lahori Gate</b><br>
    Red sandstone gate of the fortress
    The Delhi Gate, which is almost identical in appearance to the Lahori Gate
    The Lahori Gate is the main gate to the Red Fort, named for its orientation towards the city of Lahore. During
    Aurangzeb's reign, the beauty of the gate was altered by the addition of a barbican, which Shah Jahan described as
    "a veil drawn across the face of a beautiful woman".Every Indian Independence Day since 1947, the
    national flag is unfurled and the prime minister makes a speech from its ramparts.

    <br><b>Delhi Gate</b><br>
    The Delhi Gate is the southern public entrance and is similar in layout and appearance to the Lahori Gate. Two
    life-size stone elephants on either side of the gate face each other.

    <br><b>Chhatta Chowk</b><br>
    Adjacent to the Lahori Gate is the Chhatta Chowk (or Meena Bazaar), where silk, jewellery and other items for the
    imperial household were sold during the Mughal period. This market was earlier known as Bazaar-i-Musaqqaf or
    Chatta-bazaar (both meaning "roofed market"). Lahori Gate, the entrance portal of the Red Fort, leads into an open
    outer court, where it crosses the large north–south street which originally divided the fort's military functions
    (to the west) from the palaces (to the east). The southern end of the street is the Delhi Gate
