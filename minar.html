    The <b>Qutub Minar</b>, also spelled as Qutb Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part
    of the
    Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi’s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs. It is
    a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It is one of the most visited tourist spots
    in the city, mostly built between 1199 and 1220.

    It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190, which was constructed a
    decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with
    inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing
    under the balconies" at the top of each stage.In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often
    detached from the main mosque where they exist.<br>
    <br><b>Histroy</b><br>
    The Qutb Minar was built over the ruins of the Lal Kot, the citadel of Dhillika. Qutub Minar was begun after the
    Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, which was started around 1192 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate.


    Kuttull Minor, Delhi. The Qutb Minar, 1805.
    It is usually thought that the tower is named for Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who began it. It is also possible that it is
    named after Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki a 13th-century sufi saint, because Shamsuddin Iltutmish was a devotee of
    his.

    The Minar is surrounded by several historically significant monuments of the Qutb complex. Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque,
    to the north-east of the Minar was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in A.D. 1198. It is the earliest extant - mosque
    built by the Delhi Sultans. It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters, erected with the carved
    columns and architectural members of 27 Hindu and Jaina temples, which were demolished by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak as
    recorded in his inscription on the main eastern entrance.Later, a lofty arched screen was erected, and the mosque
    was enlarged, by Shams-ud- Din Itutmish (A.D. 1210-35) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears
    an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a
    Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra.

    The mosque complex is one of the earliest that survives in the Indian subcontinent.

    The nearby pillared cupola known as "Smith's Folly" is a remnant of the tower's 19th century restoration, which
    included an ill-advised attempt to add some more stories.

    In 1505, an earthquake damaged Qutub Minar; it was repaired by Sikander Lodi. On 1 September 1803, a major
    earthquake caused serious damage. Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army renovated the tower in 1828 and
    installed a pillared cupola over the fifth story, creating a sixth. The cupola was taken down in 1848, under
    instructions from The Viscount Hardinge, who was the Governor General of India. at the time. It was reinstalled at
    ground level to the east of Qutb Minar, where it remains. This is known as "Smith's Folly".

    It was added to the list of World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993.

    <b>Patrons & Architect</b><br>
    Qutb-ud-din Aibak, a deputy of Muhammad of Ghor, who founded the Delhi Sultanate after Muhammad of Ghor's death,
    started construction of the Qutb Minar's first story in 1199. Aibak's successor and son-in-law Shamsuddin Iltutmish
    completed a further three stories.After a lightning strike in 1369 damaged the then top story, the ruler at the
    time, Firuz Shah Tughlaq, replaced the damaged story and added one more. Sher Shah Suri also added an entrance while
    he was ruling and the Mughal emperor Humayun was in exile.Pesrian-Arabic and Nagari in different sections of the
    Qutb Minar reveal the history of its construction and the later restorations and repairs by Firoz Shah Tughluq
    (1351–88) and Sikandar Lodi (1489–1517).

    The height of Qutb Minar is 72.5 meters, making it the tallest minaret in the world built of bricks.The
    tower tapers, and has a 14.3 metres (47 feet) base diameter, reducing to 2.7 metres (9 feet) at the top of the
    peak.It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.

    The whole tower contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.At the foot of the tower is the Quwat Ul Islam Mosque.
    The Minar tilts just over 65 cm from the vertical, which is considered to be within safe limits.

    Qutb Minar was an inspiration and prototype for many minarets and towers built. The Chand Minar and Mini Qutub Minar
    bear resemblance to the Qutb Minar and inspired from it.

    <b> The Stories of the Qutb Minar</b><br>
    The stories of the Qutb Minar vary in size, style, and material due to varying architects and builders constructing
    each section.

    The Basement Story of the Qutb Minar
    The Qutb Minar consists of five stories of red and grey sandstone. The lowest story, also known as the basement
    story, was completed during the lifetime of Ghiyeth al-Din Muhammad, a sultan during the Ghurid dynasty.

    It is revetted with twelve semicircular and twelve flanged pilasters that are placed in alternating order.This
    story is separated by flanges and by storied balconies, carried on Muqarnas corbels.The story is placed on top
    of a low circular plinth that is inscribed with a twelve-pointed star with a semicircle placed with each of the
    angles between the star’s points.

    There are also six horizontal bands with inscriptions inscribed in naskh, a style of Islamic calligraphy, on this
    story. The inscriptions are as follows: Quran, sura II, verses 255-60; Quran, sura LIX, verses 22-23, and attributes
    of God; The name and titles of Ghiyath al-Din; Quran, sura XLVIII, verses 1-6; The name and titles of Mu’izz al-Din;
    and Qur’anic quotations and the following titles in this much restored inscription: "The Amir, the most glorious and
    great commander of the army."This level also has inscriptions praising Muhammad of Ghor, the sultan of the
    Ghurids.

    The Second, Third, and Fourth Stories
    The second, third, and fourth stories were erected by Sham ud-Din Iltutmish, the first Muslim sovereign to rule from
    Delhi.He is considered to be the first of the Delhi Sultan dynastic line.The second and third stories are
    also revetted with twelve semicircular and twelve flanged pilasters that are placed in alternating order.These
    red sandstone columns are separated by flanges and by storied balconies, carried on Muqarnas corbels.Prior to
    its reconstruction and reduction, the fourth story was also decorated with semicircular pilasters.It was
    re-constructed in white marble and is relatively plain.

    The Fifth Story
    In 1369, the fourth story was repaired after lightning struck the minaret. During reconstruction, Sultan Firuz Shah
    Tughlaq elected to reduce the size of the fourth story and then separated it into two stories.
