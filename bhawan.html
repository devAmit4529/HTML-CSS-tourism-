    The <b>Rashtrapati Bhavan </b>, rásh-tra-pa-ti bha-vun; 'Presidential Palace'; originally
    Viceroy's House and later Government House) is the official residence of the President of India at the western end
    of Rajpath in New Delhi, India. Rashtrapati Bhavan may refer to only the 340-room main building that has the
    president's official residence, including reception halls, guest rooms and offices, also called the mansion; it may
    also refer to the entire 130-hectare (320-acre) Presidential Estate that additionally includes the presidential
    gardens, large open spaces, residences of bodyguards and staff, stables, other offices and utilities within its
    perimeter walls. In terms of area, it is the largest residence of any head of state in the world.

    <br><b>History</b><br>The Governor-General of Fort William resided in Belvedere House, Calcutta, until the early
    nineteenth century, when Government House, Calcutta (now Raj Bhavan, Kolkata) was constructed. Lord Wellesley, who
    is reputed to have said that ‘India should be governed from a palace, not from a country house’, ordered the
    construction of a grand mansion between 1799 and 1803 and in 1854, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal took up
    residence there. The decision to build a residence in New Delhi for the British Viceroy was taken after it was
    decided during the Delhi Durbar in December 1911 that the capital of India would be relocated from Calcutta to
    Delhi. When the plan for a new city, New Delhi, adjacent to end south of Old Delhi, was developed after the Delhi
    Durbar, the new palace for the Viceroy of India was given an enormous size and prominent position. About 4,000 acres
    (1,600 ha) of land was acquired to begin the construction of Viceroy's House, as it was originally called, and
    adjacent Secretariat Building between 1911 and 1916 by relocating Raisina and Malcha villages that existed there and
    their 300 families under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.

    The British architect Edwin Landseer Lutyens, a major member of the city-planning process, was given the primary
    architectural responsibility. The completed Governor-General's palace turned out very similar to the original
    sketches which Lutyens sent Herbert Baker, from Simla, on 14 June 1912. Lutyens' design is grandly classical
    overall, with colors and details inspired by Indian architecture. Lutyens and Baker, who had been assigned to work
    on Viceroy's House and the Secretariats, began on friendly terms. Baker had been assigned to work on the two
    secretariat buildings which were in front of Viceroy's House. The original plan was to have Viceroy's House on the
    top of Raisina Hill, with the secretariats lower down. It was later decided to build it 400 yards back and put both
    buildings on top of the plateau. While Lutyens wanted Viceroy's House to be higher, he was forced to move it back
    from the intended position, which resulted in a dispute with Baker. After completion, Lutyens argued with Baker,
    because the view of the front of the building was obscured by the high angle of the road.

    Lutyens campaigned for its fixing, but was not able to get it to be changed. Lutyens wanted to make a long inclined
    grade all the way to Viceroy's House with retaining walls on either side. While this would give a view of the house
    from further back, it would also cut through the square between the secretariat buildings. The committee with
    Lutyens and Baker established in January 1914 said the grade was to be no steeper than 1 in 25, though it eventually
    was changed to 1 in 22, a steeper gradient which made it more difficult to see the Viceroy's palace. While Lutyens
    knew about the gradient, and the possibility that the Viceroy's palace would be obscured by the road, it is thought
    that Lutyens did not fully realise how little the front of the house would be visible. In 1916 the Imperial Delhi
    committee dismissed Lutyens's proposal to alter the gradient. Lutyens thought Baker was more concerned with making
    money and pleasing the government, rather than making a good architectural design.

    Lutyens travelled between India and England almost every year for twenty years and worked on the construction of
    Viceroy's House in both countries. Lutyens reduced the building from 13,000,000 cubic feet (370,000 m3) to 8,500,000
    cubic feet (240,000 m3) because of the budget restrictions of Lord Hardinge. While Hardinge demanded that costs be
    reduced, he nevertheless wanted the house to retain a certain amount of ceremonial grandeur.

    The gardens were initially designed and laid out in Mughal style by William Robert Mustoe who was influenced by Lady
    Hardinge who in turn had sought inspiration in the book by Constance Villiers-Stuart in her Gardens of the Great
    Mughals (1913). The designs underwent changes and alterations under subsequent viceroys and after Indian
    Independence. After independence, it was renamed as Government House.

    When Chakravarti Rajagopalachari assumed office as the first Indian-born Governor General of India and became the
    occupant of this palace, he preferred to stay in a few rooms in the former Guest Wing, which is now the family wing
    of the President; he converted the then Viceroy's apartments into the Guest Wing, where visiting heads of state stay
    while in India.

    On 26 January 1950, when Rajendra Prasad became the first President of India and occupied this building, it was
    renamed as Rashtrapati Bhavan – the President's House.

    <br><b>Design and structure</b><br>

    Consisting of four floors and 340 rooms, with a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2), it was built using 1
    billion bricks and 3,000,000 cu ft (85,000 m3) of stone with little steel.

    The design of the building fell into the time period of the Edwardian Baroque, a time at which emphasis was placed
    on the use of heavy classical motifs in order to emphasise power and imperial authority. The design process of the
    mansion was long, complicated and politically charged. Lutyens' early designs were all starkly classical and
    entirely European in style. His disrespect for the local building tradition he dismissed as primitive is evident in
    his numerous sketches with appended scrawls such as 'Moghul tosh' and his short remark that 'they want me to do
    Hindu – Hindon't I say!' In the post-Mutiny era, however, it was decided that sensitivity must be shown to the local
    surroundings in order to better integrate the building within its political context, and after much political debate
    Lutyens conceded to incorporating local Indo-Saracenic motifs, albeit in a rather superficial decorational form on
    the skin of the building.

    Various Indian elements were added to the building. These included several circular stone basins on top of the
    building, as water features are an important part of Indian architecture. There was also a traditional Indian chujja
    or chhajja, which occupied the place of a frieze in classical architecture; it was a sharp, thin, protruding element
    which extended 8 feet (2.4 m) from the building, and created deep shadows. It blocks harsh sunlight from the windows
    and also shields the windows from heavy rain during the monsoon season. On the roofline were several chuttris, which
    helped to break up the flatness of the roofline not covered by the dome. Lutyens appropriated some Indian design
    elements, but used them sparingly and effectively throughout the building.


    Jaipur Column There were also statues of elephants and fountain sculptures of cobras, as well as the bas-reliefs
    around the base of the Jaipur Column, made by British sculptor, Charles Sargeant Jagger.from west with north
    block at Rashtrapati Bhawan
    The column has a "distinctly peculiar crown on top, a glass star springing out of bronze lotus blossom".

    There were pierced screens in red sandstone, called jalis or jaalis, inspired by Rajasthani designs. The front
    of the palace, on the east side, has twelve unevenly spaced massive columns with the Delhi Order capitals, a "nonce
    order" Lutyens invented for this building, with Ashokan details. The capitals have a fusion of acanthus leaves
    with the four pendant Indian bells. The bells are similar in style to Indian Hindu and Buddhist temples, the idea
    being inspired from a Jain temple at Moodabidri in Karnataka.[citation needed] One bell is on each corner at the top
    of the column. As there is an ancient Indian belief that bells signalled the end of a dynasty, it was said that as
    the bells were silent British rule in India would not end.The front of the building does not have windows,
    except in the wings at the sides.

    Whereas previous British examples of so-called Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture had mostly grafted elements from
    Mughal architecture onto essentially Western carcasses, Lutyens drew also from the much earlier Buddhist Mauryan
    art. This can be seen in the Dehli Order, and in the main dome, where the drum below has decoration recalling the
    railings around early Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi. There is also the presence of Mughal and European colonial
    architectural elements. Overall the structure is distinctly different from other contemporary British Colonial
    symbols, although other New Delhi buildings, such as the Secretariat Building, New Delhi, mainly by Herbert Baker,
    have similarities.

    Lutyens added several small personal elements to the house, such as an area in the garden walls and two ventilator
    windows on the stateroom to look like the glasses which he wore. The Viceregal Lodge was completed largely by 1929,
    and (along with the rest of New Delhi) inaugurated officially in 1931. The building took seventeen years to complete
    and eighteen years later India became independent. After Indian independence in 1947, the now ceremonial
    Governor-General continued to live there, being succeeded by the President in 1950 when India became a republic and
    the house was renamed "Rashtrapati Bhavan".

    It has 355 decorated rooms and a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). The structure includes 700 million
    bricks and 3.5 million cubic feet (85,000 m³) of stone, with only minimal usage of steel. Lutyens established
    ateliers in Delhi and Lahore to employ local craftsmen. The chief engineer of the project was Sir Teja Singh Malik,
    and four main contractors included Sir Sobha Singh.
