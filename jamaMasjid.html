    The Masjid-i Jehan-Numa (lit. 'World-reflecting Mosque'), commonly known as the Jama Masjid of Delhi, is one of the
    largest mosques in India.

    It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656, and inaugurated by its first Imam, Syed Abdul
    Ghafoor Shah Bukhari. Situated in the Mughal capital of Shahjahanabad (today Old Delhi), it served as the imperial
    mosque of the Mughal emperors until the demise of the empire in 1857. The Jama Masjid was regarded as a symbolic
    node of Islamic power across India, well into the colonial era. It was also a site of political significance during
    several key periods of British rule. It remains in active use, and is one of Delhi's most iconic sites, closely
    identified with the ethos of Old Delhi.<br>
    The mosque has two names. The older one, bestowed by Shah Jahan, is 'Masjid-i-Jeh훮n-Num훮', roughly translating to
    "mosque commanding the view of the world" in Persian and Urdu. The other more common one is 'J훮m훮 Masjid', which
    emerged among the common populace.Its literal translation in Arabic is "congregational mosque". It is used in
    the sense of 'Friday mosque' (Juma Masjid), since this is when the congregational prayer is held. The term 'Jama
    Masjid' is not unique to Delhi's mosque; since the 7th century, it has been used in the Islamic world to denote the
    community mosque, and hence many around the world bear this name and its variants.<br>
    The mosque is located within the historic city of Shahjahanabad, today known as the locality of Old Delhi. Across
    from the mosque are the Red Fort and Sunehri Masjid.As one of the focal points of Old Delhi, Jama Masjid is
    surrounded by various commercial centres, such as the historic Chandni Chowk.The tomb of Abul Kalam Azad, Indian
    independence activist, is located adjacent to the mosque.

    <b>Architecture</b><br>
    The Jama Masjid was built as a part of Shah Jahan's new capital in Delhi, Shahjahanabad. It is considered the best
    among all mosques built during the Mughal Empire, as it has the best mixture of marble and limestone.[38] At the
    time of its construction, it was the largest mosque in the Indian subcontinent. Shah Jahan claimed that the mosque
    was modelled after the Jama Masjid of Fatehpur Sikri, and this is reflected in the design of many exterior features,
    such as the facade and courtyard. However, the interior of the mosque more closely resembles the Jama Masjid in
    Agra.The mosque predominantly uses red sandstone, and is set apart from its predecessors by a more extensive
    usage of white marble. Black marble also features as a decorative element.Arabic and Persian calligraphic
    pieces are found on various surfaces of the structure, whose content ranges from religious to panegyric.

    Having been built on a hill, the mosque is situated on a plinth elevated 10 metres above the surrounding
    city.The complex is oriented such that the back wall faces the west, towards Mecca.An imperial college,
    imperial dispensary, and madrasa used to lie adjacent to the structure, but were destroyed in the uprisings of 1857.

    The mosque is accessed by three sandstone gates. The most prominent of these is the three-storey high eastern gate,
    which historically acted as the shahi (royal) entrance, reserved only for the use of the Emperor and his associates.
    The other two entrances are the northern and southern gates, which are two stories high and were used by the general
    population.Each gate is accompanied by a three-sided sandstone stairway, with white markings to designate
    prayer positions.The cabinet located in the north gate has a collection of relics of Muhammad - the Quran
    written on deerskin, a red beard-hair of the prophet, his sandals and his footprints embedded in a marble block.
