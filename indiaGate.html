    The <b>India Gate </b>(formerly known as the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath,
    on the
    eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 90,000
    soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders,
    Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan
    War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the
    gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the memorial arch such as the
    Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in
    Mumbai.

    Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a reversed
    rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure,
    called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown
    soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister
    visits the gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts. India
    Gate is often a location for civil society protests.

    <br><b>History</b><br>The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), which came into existence in
    December 1918 under the British rule for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who were killed in the First
    World War. The foundation stone of the gate then called the All India War Memorial, was laid on 10 February 1921,
    at 16:30, by the visiting Duke of Connaught in a ceremony attended by Officers and Men of the British Indian Army,
    Imperial Service Troops, the Commander in Chief, and Chelmsford, the viceroy.On the occasion, the viceroy is
    reported to have said, "The stirring tales of individual heroism, will live forever in the annals of this country",
    and that the memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes, "known and unknown", would inspire future
    generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and "no less valour".The Duke also read out a message by
    the King, which said, "On this spot, in the central vista of the Capital of India, there will stand a Memorial
    Archway, designed to keep", in the thoughts of future generations, "the glorious sacrifice of the officers and men
    of the British Indian Army who fought and fell". During the ceremony, the Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and Miners, 6th
    Jat Light Infantry, 34th Sikh Pioneers, 39th Garhwal Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas,
    and 5th Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force), were honoured with the title of "Royal" in recognition of the distinguished
    services and gallantry of the British Indian Army during the Great War".

    Ten years after the foundation stone laying ceremony, on 12 February 1931, the memorial was inaugurated by Lord
    Irwin, who on the occasion said "those who after us shall look upon this monument may learn in pondering its purpose
    something of that sacrifice and service which the names upon its walls record."In the decade between the laying
    of foundation stone of the memorial and its inauguration, the rail-line was shifted to run along the Yamuna river,
    and the New Delhi Railway Station was opened in 1926.

    The gate, which is illuminated every evening from 19:00 to 21:30, today serves as one of Delhi's most important
    tourist attractions. Cars used to travel through the gate until it was closed to traffic.[citation needed] The
    Republic Day Parade starts from Rashtrapati Bhavan and passes around the India Gate.[citation needed] India gate is
    often a location for civil society protests, including demonstrations in response to the Nirbhaya rape case in 2012
    and the Unnao rape case in 2017, and as part of the 2011 anti-corruption movement.

    In 2017, the India Gate was twinned with the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, England,[further explanation needed]
    another Lutyens war memorial, following a very similar design but on a smaller scale. In a ceremony, India's high
    commissioner to the United Kingdom laid a wreath at the arch in Leicester and the British high commissioner to India
    laid one at the India Gate.<br>

    <br><b>Design and structure</b><br>

    India gate, as seen from Rajpath
    The memorial-gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was not only the main architect of New Delhi, but also a
    member of the Imperial War Graves Commission and one of Europe's foremost designers of war graves and memorials. He
    designed sixty-six war memorials in Europe, including the highly regarded Cenotaph in London in 1919, the first
    national war memorial erected after World War I, for which he was commissioned by David Lloyd George, the British
    prime minister.[3] The memorial in New Delhi, like the Cenotaph in London, is a secular memorial, free of religious
    and "culturally-specific iconography such as crosses". Lutyens according to his biographer, Christopher Hussey,
    relied on the "elemental mode", a style of commemoration based on "universal architectural style free of religious
    ornamentation".

    The India gate, which has been called a "creative reworking of the Arc de Triomphe" has a span of 30 feet, and lies
    on the eastern axial end of Kingsway, present day Rajpath, the central vista and main ceremonial procession route in
    New Delhi.[3] The 42-metre (138-foot)-tall India gate, stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in
    stages to a huge moulding. The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on
    anniversaries but this is rarely done.[citation needed] The memorial-gate hexagon complex, with a diameter of about
    625 metres, covers approximately 306,000 m2 in area.<br>

    <br><b>Inscriptions</b><br>
    The cornice of the India Gate is inscribed with Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by
    the dates MCMXIV ('1914'; on the left) and MCMXIX ('1919'; on the right). Below the word INDIA, in capital letters,
    is inscribed:


    Inscription at top of the gate
    To the dead of the Indian Armies who fell and are honoured in France and Flanders, Mesopotamia and Persia, East
    Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and Far East and in Sacred Memory also of those whose names are here
    recorded and who fell in India on the North West Frontier and during the Third Afghan War.

    13,313 names are engraved out of which 12,357 are Indian.[1][2] Access to read the names on the memorial is
    restricted, though they can be seen on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) website, which lists the names
    with their respective date of death, unit name, regiment, place on gate where name is inscribed, location, and other
    information)
