    <b>The Lotus Temple </b>, located in Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986. Notable
    for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all other Bahá’í Houses of Worship,
    the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. The building is composed of 27
    free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,with nine doors opening onto
    a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 1,300 people.The Lotus Temple has
    won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.

    The Lotus Temple was dedicated 23–27 December 1986 with a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including
    some 4,000 Baháʼís from 22 provinces in India. On 1 January the temple was opened to the public and more than 10,000
    people visited that first day.

    By late 2001, it had attracted more than 70 million visitors according to Manpreet Brar, a CNN reporter.The
    permanent delegation of India to UNESCO stated that the Lotus Temple has received over 100 million visitors by April
    2014.

    All Baháʼí Houses of Worship, including the Lotus Temple, share certain architectural elements, some of which are
    specified by Baháʼí scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, stipulated that an essential
    architectural character of a House of Worship is a nine-sided circular shape.While all current Baháʼí Houses of
    Worship have a dome, this is not regarded as an essential part of their architecture.Baháʼí scripture also
    states that no pictures, statues or images be displayed within the House of Worship and no pulpits or altars be
    incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand behind simple portable lecture stands).

    Inspired by the lotus flower, the design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is composed of 27 free-standing
    marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides.The nine doors of the Lotus Temple open
    onto a central hall 34.3 meters tall that can seat 1,300 people and hold up to 2,500 in all.The surface of
    the House of Worship is made of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble used in the
    construction of many ancient monuments (including the Parthenon) and other Baháʼí buildings.Along with its
    nine surrounding ponds and gardens, the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m²; 10.5 ha).

    Lotus temple is situated near Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir metro station is just 500 meters away.

    The temple is located in the village of Bahapur in New Delhi, National Capital Territory of Delhi. The architect was
    an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla, California,after living some years in Canada.He was
    approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction. The structural design was
    undertaken by the UK firm Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months,and the construction was done by ECC
    Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited at a cost of $10 million.The major part of the funds needed
    to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose will dictated that his
    entire life savings would go to this purpose.A portion of the construction budget was saved and used to build a
    greenhouse to study indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site.

    Of the temple's total electricity use of 500 kilowatts (kW), 120 kW is provided by solar power generated by solar
    panels on the building.This saves the temple ₹120,000 per month.It is the first temple in Delhi to use
    solar power.
