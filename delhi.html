    <b>Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi</b>, is a city and a union territory of
    India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or
    right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the
    remaining directions. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). According to the 2011
    census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,while the NCT's population was about 16.8
    million. Delhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and
    Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making
    it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).

    The topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of
    the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs
    of an ancient built environment. From the early 13th-century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of
    two major empires, the Delhi sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. All three
    UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort belong to this period.
    Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are
    prominently associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise
    to the literature of the Urdu language and then of Modern Standard Hindi. Major Urdu poets from Delhi are Mir Taqi
    Mir, and Mirza Ghalib. Delhi was a major centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In 1911, New Delhi, a southern
    region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire. During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi
    was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslims residents, in part to the
    pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu refugees from western Punjab.After independence in 1947, New Delhi
    continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of India.

    Delhi is home to the second highest number of billionaires and millionaires of any city in India.Delhi ranks
    fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index.Delhi has the second-highest GDP
    per capita in India (after Goa).Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi
    today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council
    of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and
    the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also
    the centre of the National Capital Region, which is a 'interstate regional planning' area created in 1985.
    Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, 1982 Asian Games, 1983 NAM Summit, 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, 2010
    Commonwealth Games, 2012 BRICS Summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

    As a first-level administrative division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly,
    Lieutenant Governor, the council of ministers, and Chief Minister. Members of the legislative assembly are directly
    elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT. The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which
    direct federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993. The Municipal corporation handles civic
    administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of
    National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located. The Parliament of
    India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat, and the Supreme Court of India are located
    in the municipal district of New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian
    parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.The Indian National Congress (Congress) formed all the
    governments in Delhi until the 1990s, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Madan Lal Khurana, came to
    power.In 1998, the Congress returned to power under the leadership of Sheila Dikshit, who was subsequently
    re-elected for 3 consecutive terms. But in 2013, the Congress was ousted from power by the newly formed Aam Aadmi
    Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal forming the government with outside support from the Congress.However, that
    government was short-lived, collapsing only after 49 days.Delhi was then under President's rule until February
    2015.On 10 February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power after a landslide victory, winning 67 out of
    the 70 seats in the Delhi Legislative Assembly.
