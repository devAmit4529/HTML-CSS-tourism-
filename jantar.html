    A <b>Jantar Mantar </b>(Hindustani pronunciation: [d͡ʒən̪t̪ər mən̪t̪ər]) is an assembly of stone-built astronomical
    instruments, designed to be used with the naked eye. There were five Jantar Mantars in India, all of them built at
    the command of the Rajah Jai Singh II, who had a keen interest in mathematics, architecture and astronomy; four
    remain, as the Jantar Mantar at Mathura was torn down just before the revolt of 1857. The largest example is the
    equinoctial sundial belonging to Jaipur's assembly of instruments, consisting of a gigantic triangular gnomon with
    the hypotenuse parallel to the Earth's axis. On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle, parallel to the
    plane of the equator. The instrument can be used with an accuracy of about 2 seconds by a "skilled observer" to
    measure the time of day, and the declination of the Sun and the other heavenly bodies. It is the world's largest
    stone sundial, known as the Vrihat Samrat Yantra.The Jaipur Jantar Mantar is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
